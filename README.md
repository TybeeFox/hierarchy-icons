# Hierarchy Icons
This is a Unity Editor utility that displays small icons alongside Prefab Instances in the Hierarchy window.

<b><i>Note: This Utility no longer works in Unity 2018.3.X.</i></b>

What can I do with the code?
- You can pretty much do whatever you want with the code provided here, just don't go trying to sell it, that's kind of a shitty thing to do given that I've released it here for free.
- You're welcome to integrate it into larger projects and/or frameworks if you want, you're not expected to release your entire code base as a result of integrating this into a larger project or collection of code, that would be a bit silly.

What's this?
- It's a class that adds little icons alongside items in the hierarchy, you can alter the appearance and position of the icons from Unity's Preferences panel from the Hierarchy tab added by this class.

How do I use it?
- Download 'HierarchyIcons.cs' or clone the repo if you like.
- Add 'HierarchyIcons.cs' to your Unity project within a folder called 'Editor'.
- By default it should enable Asset Preview icons.
- To change the appearance and position of the icons simply open the Preferences panel in Unity and navigate to the Hierarchy tab.
